## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![linear_regression](https://github.com/pcar22/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/linear_regression.png)

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    - The two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance are the vehicle length and ground clearance. The p-value shows a high level of significance.

2. Is the sloope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    - The slope is not considered to be zero. Some independent variables, such as vehicle length and ground clearance had a significant effect on the dependent variable.

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
    - Based on the data, the multiple R-squared value is 0.7149 and that is approximately a 71% rate of prediciton. 


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.
1. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
    - Testing line.
